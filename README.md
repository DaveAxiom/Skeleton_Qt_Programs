# Skeleton_Qt_Programs

Stripped down sample Qt programs. These sample programs can be a good start for a student or a template for a test program. They are bare and minor modifications might disqualify them as derivative works.

## Skeleton_Qt_Thread

Demonstration of a bare QThread with a worker object.

## Skeleton_Qt_SVG

Demonstration of code to plot an SVG image. At this time, the Qt library doesn't provide a straightforward method to display SVG. With analysis of the Qt library, this work could be a candidate for upstream inclusion.
